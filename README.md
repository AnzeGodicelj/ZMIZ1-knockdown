# ZMIZ1-knockdown

MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were silenced for ZMIZ1 protein or transfected with non-targeting silencing RNA (siCTRL). Differential expression analysis (siZMIZ1 vs siCTRL) was performed using DESeq2. Gene set enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes showed downregulation of cell cycle/proliferation pathways and in pathays implicated in the development of cancer.
