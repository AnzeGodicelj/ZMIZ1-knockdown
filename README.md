# ZMIZ1-knockdown

MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were silenced for ZMIZ1 protein or transfected with cintrol silencing rna (siCTRL). Differential expression analysis (siZMIZ1 vs siCTRL) was performed using DESeq2. Gene set enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes showed downregulation of cell cycle/proliferation pathways and in pathays imlicated in the development of cancer.
